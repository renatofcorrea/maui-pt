This is the Windows distribution of the TreeTagger.

It contains the following files:

- tree-tagger.exe: the tagger program

- train-tree-tagger.exe: the training program

- tokenize.pl:      A Perl script which transforms the tagger input
                    into one-word-perl-line format

- *-abbreviations:  abbreviation lists required by the tokenizer

- tag-*.bat:        batch files for different languages which call 
                    the tokeniser and the tagger 

- chunk-*.bat	    batch files for POS tagging and chunking


Installation
------------

1. Install a Perl interpreter (if you have not already installed one).
   You can download a Perl interpreter for Windows for free at
   http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/

2. Move the TreeTagger directory to the root directory of drive C:.

3. Download the PC parameter files for the languages you need, decompress
   them (e.g. using Winzip or 7zip) and move them to the subdirectory lib.
   Rename the parameter files to <language>.par
   Example: Rename french-par-linux-3.1.bin to french.par

   The UTF8 versions of the parameter files are not supported yet, but
   see below some hints on how to build tagging scripts for the UTF8
   parameter files.

4. Add the path C:\TreeTagger\bin to the PATH environment variable.

5. Open a shell and type the command
   set PATH=C:\TreeTagger\bin;%PATH%

6. Change to the directory C:\TreeTagger

7. Now you can test the tagger, e.g. by analyzing this file with the command
   tag-english INSTALL.txt

If you install the TreeTagger in a different directory, you have to
modify the first path in the batch files tag-*.bat.


Michaela Atterer told me that she had difficulties to install the
TreeTagger on a Windows XP system. She recommends the following
work-around.

4. Windows XP:
-Right click on "My Computer"
-Select the "Advanced" tab
-Click on "Environment Variables"
-click on New: enter PATH and C:\TreeTagger\bin\;%PATH%

If the files have been unpacked into a single directory, you should restore the following directory structure:

TreeTagger:
INSTALL.txt  README.txt  bin  cmd  lib

TreeTagger/bin:
tag-english.bat  tag-german.bat   tag-spanish.bat        tree-tagger.exe
tag-french.bat   tag-italian.bat  train-tree-tagger.exe

TreeTagger/cmd:
mwl-lookup.perl  tokenize.pl

TreeTagger/lib:
english-abbreviations  german-abbreviations   spanish-abbreviations
french-abbreviations   italian-abbreviations  spanish-mwls


Note that the TreeTagger comes without a graphical interface. You have
to start it by entering a command in a command line window. If you
prefer a graphical interface, try the one provided by Ciar n Ò Duibh¡n

http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/~oduibhin/oideasra/interfaces/winttinterface.htm


UTF8

The UTF8 versions of the TreeTagger parameter files are not supported
yet under Windows. If you need utf8 support you could try to build a
utf8 version of the - say - tag-french.bat script by

- replacing the standard tokenizer "tokenize.pl" by "utf8-tokenizer.perl"
- converting the file "french-abbreviations" to utf8
